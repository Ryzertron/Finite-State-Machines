# Cycle Detector
### Implement a Cycle Detector in Verilog to find the sequence ‘101001’ in a well-defined serial input bit stream using minimum number of states. Make sure to include the overlapping conditions also.

    Example:
    Input Stream:   0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
    FSM Output:     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
