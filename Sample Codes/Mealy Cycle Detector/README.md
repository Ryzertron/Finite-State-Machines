# Mealy Cycle Detector

### Design and Implement a Mealy Cycle Detector which detects the bit sequence ‘10’ in a given input stream of bits based on a clock. The FSM must give output as 1 for every second occurrence of this sequence. Implement it without using additional memory for a counter which counts the number of occurrences.

    Example:  
    Input Stream:   0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0  
    FSM output:     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
